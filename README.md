# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to recommend movies to users based on their ratings and historical interactions.

## Overview

The movie recommendation system aims to suggest movies to users based on either their previous preferences or similar usersâ€™ behaviors. This approach uses various algorithms, including collaborative filtering (user-item interactions) and content-based filtering (movie attributes such as genre, director, and cast), to provide accurate and relevant recommendations.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: The system recommends movies by finding similarities between users' ratings or interactions with movies. This method assumes that users who liked similar movies in the past will continue to like similar movies in the future.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Movie recommendations are made based on the attributes of the movies (e.g., genre, director, cast). If a user liked a specific type of movie, the system suggests other movies with similar characteristics.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combining both collaborative and content-based filtering to enhance the quality of recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is typically a large collection of movie ratings and metadata (movie attributes). It contains information like:

- **Movie Titles**: Name of the movies.
- **User Ratings**: Ratings provided by users for the movies.
- **Movie Metadata**: Genres, actors, directors, and other relevant details about each movie.

For example, the **MovieLens** dataset is a commonly used dataset for building recommendation systems.

## Purpose

This movie recommendation system aims to provide personalized movie suggestions to users, making it easier for them to discover new content. The system can be applied in various streaming platforms, websites, and apps to enhance user experience by offering customized movie recommendations.

## Future Work

- **Improving Recommendation Accuracy**: Implementing additional algorithms like Matrix Factorization or deep learning models to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
- **Handling Cold Start Problem**: Developing strategies for recommending movies to new users or items with limited data.
- **User Interface**: Developing a user-friendly interface (e.g., web or mobile app) to interact with the recommendation system.
